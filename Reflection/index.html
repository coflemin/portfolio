        <h1>Program Reflection</h1>
        <p>Reflecting on my journey through the Master of Geospatial Information Science and Technology (MGIST) program at North Carolina State University, I am struck by the depth and breadth of knowledge and experiences I have gained. This program has not only equipped me with technical skills but also enriched my understanding of the real-world applications of geospatial technology.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Learnings and Experiences</h2>
        <p>Throughout the program, I engaged in a variety of courses and projects that challenged and expanded my capabilities in geospatial technology. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GIST Fundamentals:</strong> This course laid the foundation for my understanding of geospatial concepts, teaching me the importance of spatial thinking and data representation in GIS.</li>
            <li><strong>Geospatial Programming:</strong> Here, I honed my skills in Python and JavaScript, which were crucial for developing the Rapid Access Biosecurity (RAB) appâ„¢ at The Machado Lab.</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Data Foundations:</strong> I learned the intricacies of spatial data management and how to effectively utilize data in GIS applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Remote Sensing:</strong> This course allowed me to explore the use of remote sensing technologies in environmental monitoring and analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Capstone Project:</strong> My capstone project was a culmination of all the skills and knowledge I acquired, where I applied them to a real-world problem in the pork industry's biosecurity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal and Professional Growth</h2>
        <p>My time in the MGIST program was not just about academic growth but also about personal and professional development. Working on projects like the visualization of heavy metal contamination in Huancavelica, Peru, I learned the value of geospatial technology in addressing environmental and health challenges. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills and have given me a new perspective on the role of GIS in societal issues.</p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>As I near the completion of this program, I am excited about the future. The skills and insights I have gained have prepared me to contribute meaningfully to the field of geospatial technology. I look forward to applying my knowledge in new and challenging contexts, continuing to learn and grow as a professional in this dynamic field.</p>
